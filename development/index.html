	<p>Here is a selection of useful resources I have used in order to construct this site. </p>
    
  <h3>Text</h3>
  <p>This <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Tutorial</a> is simply named <em> Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</em>. It is written by
  Jonathan McGlone, who is a experienced code ninja and seems like a likable guy. Only with this tutorial I managed to put up this site
  with its main features, so thanks a lot Jonathan!</p>
