	<h1>Web Development Resources for N00bs </h1>
		<p>Here is a selection of useful resources I have used in order to construct this site. </p>
    
 	<h2>Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</h2>
		<p>This <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Tutorial</a> is simply named <em> 
			Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</em>. It is written by
			Jonathan McGlone, who is a experienced code ninja and seems like a likable guy. 
			Only with this tutorial I managed to put up this site
			with its main features, so thanks a lot Jonathan! </p>
  
  	<h2>Markdown Cheatsheet</h2>
		<p> This <a href="http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf">printable 
			cheatsheet (PDF)</a>
			is a good start when writing Markdown. </p>
  
	
 	<h2>Web development with R</h2>
  		<p>For those R fan-boys out there; it is indeed possible to smoothly write R-code and 
			convert to HTML and Markdown, with use of Shiny. I personally haven't used this 
			much yet, but check out <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/templates.html">
			Shiny HTML Templates</a> and <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rmarkdown.html">
			Shiny Introduction to Markdown</a> </p>
  
  	<h2>High level 10 min intoduction to Git</h2>
		<p>For those R fan-boys out there; it is indeed possible to smoothly write R-code and convert 
			to HTML and Markdown, with use of Shiny. I personally haven't used this much yet, but 
			feel free to check out <a href=" https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">
			this link</a>.</p>
