Here have the working document that documents my understanding of Blockchain & DLT.

How to go forward:
* Go through my whole book and make notes. Dig into the below resources if I get stuck
* Then, go through the whole GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN BENCHMARKING STUDY 
* Then, go through Vitalic posts and articles (ETH White paper, mauve, medium)
* Then, go into detail in Hyperledger and Corda

My goal is to
* Have a solid understanding of blockchain, in order to see if it is useful for the industry. Have the feeling it might be useless. 
* But at least I can get own business ideas and be an expert

Resources I need to include
* My ethereum book
* Read the whole thing: GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN BENCHMARKING STUDY Dr Garrick Hileman & Michel Rauchs
