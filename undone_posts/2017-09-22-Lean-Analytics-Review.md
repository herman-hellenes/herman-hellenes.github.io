Lean Analytics – two of the most buzzed up words put together as one concept. The book is focusing on why analytics is 
important in a business setting, and the “lean” approach of applying it in the field. It is so easy to get lost in the jungle 
of possible KPI’s; they are often too many or just inappropriate. The strongest part of the book is taking on this issue, 
starting with why you should be measuring. This is followed up by many examples from different business models, discussing 
which measures that are useful in the different cases. Note that the book is primarily is focusing on startups, but it is 
also relevant for entrepreneurs, SME-management and consultants. I will focus on the relevancy for the latter group.

After the successful Lean Startup by Eric Rice, the word “Lean” has been put 
in front many other book titles. For those of you who are not familiar with Rice, he is an
evangelist in the startup community, preaching the “lean” approach of developing new products 
and businesses. This has been influential also outside the startup scene, together with 
“Agile Development” and other similar concepts. To put it short, the Lean Startup approach 
aims for iterative development cycles, through a build-measure-learn process. It is key to 
keep the iterations short, in order to launch several “minimal viable products” (MVPs) and 
learn how the users respond into a new iteration. This way of working is now popular also consultants. 
Lean Analytics is focusing on the “measure”-step in the Lean Startup framework. With analytics, 
we try to answer “where you are” and “where you should be going”, trough gathering and analyzing data. 
As a consultant, it is essential to measure in order to show results. With no measurements, we can’t prove any change to the client.
