Lean Analytics – two of the most buzzed up words put together as one concept. The book is focusing on why analytics is 
important in a business setting, and the “lean” approach of applying it in the field. It is so easy to get lost in the jungle 
of possible KPI’s; they are often too many or just inappropriate. The strongest part of the book is taking on this issue, 
starting with why you should be measuring. This is followed up by many examples from different business models, discussing 
which measures that are useful in the different cases. Note that the book is primarily is focusing on startups, but it is 
also relevant for entrepreneurs, SME-management and consultants. I will focus on the relevancy for the latter group.

After the successful Lean Startup by Eric Rice, the word “Lean” has been put 
in front many other book titles. For those of you who are not familiar with Rice, he is an
evangelist in the startup community, preaching the “lean” approach of developing new products 
and businesses. This has been influential also outside the startup scene, together with 
“Agile Development” and other similar concepts. To put it short, the Lean Startup approach 
aims for iterative development cycles, through a build-measure-learn process. It is key to 
keep the iterations short, in order to launch several “minimal viable products” (MVPs) and 
learn how the users respond into a new iteration. This way of working is now popular also consultants. 
Lean Analytics is focusing on the “measure”-step in the Lean Startup framework. With analytics, 
we try to answer “where you are” and “where you should be going”, trough gathering and analyzing data. 
As a consultant, it is essential to measure in order to show results. With no measurements, we can’t prove any change to the client.

Perhaps the most important discussion in the book is about metrics. What makes a good metric? In the end of the day, analytics is about tracking the metrics that are critical to your project or business. Following this, a good metric changes the way you behave. For many, this seems obvious, but people are continuously avoiding this, confusing reporting metrics with actionable metrics. 
It is crucial to define metrics before running into experiments. For example, decide that if your MVP doesn’t increase order size by 30 %, try something else. A good metric changes the way you behave precisely because it is aligned to your goals of keeping users, encouraging word of mouth, acquiring customers efficiently, etc. 
In addition to use a metric that reflects your goal, it is incentivizing your team and partners to align. Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do differently based on this information?” If you can’t answer it, you probably shouldn’t care about the metric too much. Examples of a poor and a good metric can be,
* “Total signups”. This is a number that is only increasing over time. There is not much relevant information to be extracted here, when you think about it.
* “Percent of users who are active”. This is a far better one. When you change something about the product, this metric should change. That means you can experiment, learn, and iterate with it.

Croll & Yoskoviz are mentioning several rules of thumb for choosing good metrics (p9-10),

* **A good metric is comparable.** Being able to compare a metric to other time periods. Groups of users, or competitors helps you understand which way things are moving. “Increased conversion from last week” is more meaningful than “2% conversion.” 
* **A good metric is understandable.** If people can’t remember it and discuss it, it’s much harder to turn a change in the data into a change in the culture. 
* **A good metric is a ratio or a rate.** Financial analysts have several ratios they look at to understand, at a glance, the fundamental health of a company (e.g. PE-ratio). You need some, too. This because
  * **Ratios are easier to act on.** Think of driving a car; it is easier to act on the car’s speed than the total distance travelled, in the short term. 
  * **Ratios are inherently comparative.** Following the car driving analogy, the car’s average speed today can be compared to the average speed yesterday, last month, etc. By narrowing and expanding the time average you can see if there are long term trends, sudden spikes and so on.
  * **Ratios are also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed or for which there’s an inherent tension.** This can be handy for optimization; e.g. speed / traffic tickets. Then you see the trade-off clearly
* **A good metric changes the way you behave.** As mentioned above.
