Hi there, I hope you have a great day. Are you open for some toughts on how effectivly measure KPIs in a business, which KPIs are relevant and why you should at all bother? 

These topics are crucial for leaders, business analysts as well as data scientists. Metrics that drive change and incorporate the firm's strategy are vital to put in place by the leaders. A business analyst help out with this and give supplementing measures to tell a more nuanced view. Data Scientists often try to improve key metrics aligned with the firm's strategy and need to show with hard numbers if their contribution succeeded. If any of this roles and topics seems familiar, this book review would hopefully be interesting..

After the successful book "Lean Startup" by Eric Rice, the word “Lean” has somewhat been reincarnated from the well known Lean Manifacturing put forward by Toyota and others. Lean Analytics is a spin-off from Rice's first book, written by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz. Rice is an evangelist in the startup community, preaching the “lean” approach of developing new products 
and businesses. To put it short, the Lean Startup approach aims for iterative development cycles, through a build-measure-learn process. It is key to keep the iterations short, in order to launch several “minimal viable products” (MVPs) and 
learn how the users respond into a new iteration. This way of working is now popular also among consultants and incumbents.

Lean Analytics is focusing on the “measure”-step in the Lean Startup framework. With analytics, 
we try to answer “where you are” and “where you should be going”, trough gathering and analyzing data. 
As a consultant, it is essential to measure in order to show results. With no measurements, we can’t prove any change to the client.

## What makes a good metric? 

In the end of the day, analytics is about tracking the metrics that are critical to your project or business. Following this, a good metric changes the way you behave. For many, this seems obvious, but people are continuously avoiding this, confusing reporting metrics with actionable metrics. 
It is crucial to define metrics before running into experiments. For example, decide that if your MVP doesn’t increase order size by 30 %, try something else. A good metric changes the way you behave precisely because it is aligned to your goals of keeping users, encouraging word of mouth, acquiring customers efficiently, etc. 
In addition to use a metric that reflects your goal, it is incentivizing your team and partners to align. Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do differently based on this information?” If you can’t answer it, you probably shouldn’t care about the metric too much. Examples of a poor and a good metric can be,
* “Total signups”. This is a number that is only increasing over time. There is not much relevant information to be extracted here, when you think about it.
* “Percent of users who are active”. This is a far better one. When you change something about the product, this metric should change. That means you can experiment, learn, and iterate with it.

Croll & Yoskoviz are mentioning several rules of thumb for choosing good metrics,

* **A good metric is comparable.** Being able to compare a metric to other time periods. Groups of users, or competitors helps you understand which way things are moving. “Increased conversion from last week” is more meaningful than “2% conversion.” 
* **A good metric is understandable.** If people can’t remember it and discuss it, it’s much harder to turn a change in the data into a change in the culture. 
* **A good metric is a ratio or a rate.** Financial analysts have several ratios they look at to understand, at a glance, the fundamental health of a company (e.g. PE-ratio). You need some, too. This because
  * **Ratios are easier to act on.** Think of driving a car; it is easier to act on the car’s speed than the total distance travelled, in the short term. 
  * **Ratios are inherently comparative.** Following the car driving analogy, the car’s average speed today can be compared to the average speed yesterday, last month, etc. By narrowing and expanding the time average you can see if there are long term trends, sudden spikes and so on.
  * **Ratios are also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed or for which there’s an inherent tension.** This can be handy for optimization; e.g. speed / traffic tickets. Then you see the trade-off clearly
* **A good metric changes the way you behave.** As mentioned above.


## The One Metric That Matters

Now we have some hints of how to choose good metrics. However, how many should we highlight as important? We should at least have One Metric That Matters. This metric should fulfill the following

* It answers the most important question you have. 
* It forces you to draw a line in the sand and have clear goals.
* It focuses the entire company.
* It inspires a culture of experimentation.

This does not imply that you only have one metric, it is useful to keep an eye on dozens of metrics, but they are then subordered. The idea of having this “übermetric” is quite powerful, especially due to aligning the team, aiming for a common and tangible goal. This being said, this metric can and will change in time, when the focus needs to be shifted in the project or business as a whole. It should reflect your most important goal today. For most businesses, it is not trivial to define such metric. Just to find this most important goal is a very valuable exercise in it self. **If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.**



## Wrapup

Lean Analytics is much more about **what** and **why** you should measure, not that much about how. That’s completely ok, since this book is not trying to target Advanced Analytics such as predictive modelling in any great extent, but rather focus on simple “BI” measurements. In both cases, it is just as important to discuss the what and why before diving into technicalities and modelling, in order to produce value.

The book contains several case studies, which can be good for practical understanding. There are six broad business models that’s investigated; E-commerce, SaaS, Free Mobile App, Media Site, User-Generated Content and Two-Sided Marketplace. Even though none of these are directly of your interest, there should be some overlap with the particular business model you are concerned of.

Croll & Yoskoviz are giving a reflected story of why some metrics are appropriate, whereas many are not. The idea that metrics should always drive action is specially interesting, this is the only way a company truly can be data-driven, compared to just have a bunch of data.
