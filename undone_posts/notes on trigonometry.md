Hi there, I hope you have a great day. I have been thinking of this for quite some time; we quickly forget what we have learned. For people learning a lot of new stuff and skills, of course this happens. However, the other day I had to quickly read up on Derivative Pricing and Quantitative Risk Management, which I haven't payd too much attention to in a while. Luckily I had ready great notes from my university courses and slides I've done at work, so the task was not too bad. Therefore, I've decided to try to recap important stuff I know now and then, to keep it rather fresh in mind.

First off, I start all the way back to high school. I realized; if someone asked me "what is Cosine?", I would have to think a bit to get a good and precise answer. So now I try to do a repetiotion of the key concepts of trigonometry.

### Why does trigonometry matters?
Might for many people seem like a stupid question, but it is still essensial. Wikipedia says "Trigonometry (from Greek trig≈çnon, "triangle" and metron, "measure") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles."

Well, that is for sure right. But the applications are far more broad than just to fool around with a single triangle, which we usually do in high school. Funny enough, trigonometry is a key tool used to describe nature. It sounds obious that trigonometry is usefull when constructing a building, however there are so many natural motions that also can be described with these trigonometric functions. We describe light and physical waves with trigonometric functions, and even matter in quantum physics, as well as more practical oriented engineering. A simple, and important, example is describing the movement of a ball attached to a spring.

### Let's start with the "beginning"
Trigonometry starts back with Pythagoras. His theorem says that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 

$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, where a is the hypotenuse.
