Hi there, I hope you have a great day. I have been thinking of this for quite some time; we quickly forget what we have learned. For people learning a lot of new stuff and skills, of course this happens. However, the other day I had to quickly read up on Derivative Pricing and Quantitative Risk Management, which I haven't payd too much attention to in a while. Luckily I had ready great notes from my university courses and slides I've done at work, so the task was not too bad. Therefore, I've decided to try to recap important stuff I know now and then, to keep it rather fresh in mind.

First off, I start all the way back to high school. I realized; if someone asked me "what is Cosine?", I would have to think a bit to get a good and precise answer. So now I try to do a repetiotion of the key concepts of trigonometry.

### Why does trigonometry matters?
Might for many people seem like a stupid question, but it is still essensial. Wikipedia says "Trigonometry (from Greek trigōnon, "triangle" and metron, "measure") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles."

Well, that is for sure right. But the applications are far more broad than just to fool around with a single triangle, which we usually do in high school. Funny enough, trigonometry is a key tool used to describe nature. It sounds obious that trigonometry is usefull when constructing a building, however there are so many natural motions that also can be described with these trigonometric functions. We describe light and physical waves with trigonometric functions, and even matter in quantum physics, as well as more practical oriented engineering. A simple, and important, example is describing the movement of a ball attached to a spring.

### Let's start with the "beginning" - Pythagoras
Trigonometry starts back with Pythagoras. His theorem says that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So first, how did he come up with this? One way to prove it, there are many, is the proof of rearrangement. This is shown below in the animation, and is indeed a intuitive presentation.

## Recalling trigonometric functions 
Now, we get the above, but how was this sine, cosine stuff again? We are talking about trigonometric functions; functions of an angle. They all relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. What many recall, is that you had a task to calculate one side of a triagle, where an angle the length of another side is known. This is a very practical problem, which shows up in all kinds of scenarios. But what we usually did, is that we looked up the formulas for sine, cosine and so on, perhaps did some algebra, and we got to the solution! The trigonometric functions can be defined in several ways, where each definition brings along its own intuition. We will walk through them straight away.

### Right-angled triangle definitions
For any right-angeled triangle, the trigonometric functions are some ratio of the lenghts in the triangle. That's it! See the table below for the definitions.

### Unit-circle definitions
This is a bit more interesting approach if you'd ask me. 

The six trigonometric functions can also be defined in terms of the unit circle, the circle of radius one centered at the origin. While right-angled triangle definitions permit the definition of the trigonometric functions for angles between 0 and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}
radians, the unit circle definition extends the definitions of the trigonometric functions to all positive and negative arguments.
The equation for the unit circle is

The equation for the unit circle is
: <math>x^2 + y^2 = 1.</math>

Let a line through the center {{mvar|O}} of the circle, making an angle of {{mvar|θ}} with the positive half of the {{mvar|x}}-axis. The line intersects the unit circle at a point ''A'' whose {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-coordinates are {{math|cos(''θ'')}} and {{math|sin(''θ'')}} respectively

### Series definitions

#### Relationship to exponential function and complex numbers
It can be shown from the series definitions[14] that the sine and cosine functions are respectively the imaginary and real parts of the exponential function of a purely imaginary argument

Tell also here relation to unit circle !
### Important properties

differential equation chapter wiki -  each is the additive inverse of its own second derivative. this is why it is usefull in describing waves

Also mention there are a lot of nice Identities. Not in detail here though. Include here wikichap Properties and applications. Specially add this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#/media/File:Sawtooth_Fourier_Animation.gif. So its good to describe "whatever function", useful in optics, quantum, etc
