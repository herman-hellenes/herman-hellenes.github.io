Hey there you beautiful ladies and gentlemen, señoras y señores, damen und herren, 女士们(們) 先生们(們 ! Hope you have a great day. I am now making a "series" of posts regarding Machine Learning. They will vary from the conceptual level, the low level technicalities, to some inspirations to applications. 


### Setting the stage and uncover the myth of Machine Learning

Machine Learning, Artificial Intellegence, Big Data. There is such a great hype for these techniques, specially among non-technical folks. There is a conception that these techniques are able to solve all kinds of problem, in a hassle free way. People are going to loose their jobs and we will soon end up as in the Matrix. I will try to make an own post regarding this, if machines really can be intelligent. For now, assume that that's not the case. It will be blood, sweat, toil and tears to pull off any real-world Machine Learning project. 

We will did into the concept of Machine Learning (ML). ML is less rocket science than you would think
