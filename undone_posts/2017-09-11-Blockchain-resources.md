Hey there you beautiful ladies and gentlemen, señoras y señores, damen und herren, 女士们(們) 先生们(們 ! Hope you have a great day. 
I will here just temporarily store my resources on Blockchain. Perhaps I will write my code here at Github too.. Lets see!


### EY
* [Better-working
insurance: moving
blockchain from
concept to reality](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-better-working-insurance-moving-blockchain-from-concept-to-reality/$FILE/ey-better-working-insurance-moving-blockchain-from-concept-to-reality.pdf). 20-week proof-of-concept project with EY, Guardtime and Maersk. A working blockchain platform that connects every major stakeholder in the insurance value chain. 
  * Challenge: It can
complicate risks in a number of areas. This is because
multiple parties in multiple jurisdictions – from ship
and cargo owners to surveyors and port authorities –
must align around a single insurance contract.
  * Challenge: The great strength of blockchain – its ability to create
a single version of the truth – could also become a
source of systemic risk, if truth becomes falsehood.
There must be clear controls around what data
organizations are storing and what data participants
have permission to use.



* [Blockchain Implications for the insurance industry](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-blockchain-technology-as-a-platform-for-digitization/$FILE/EY-blockchain-technology-as-a-platform-for-digitization.pdf). Good for understanding and discussing possible use-cases. Not proper projects
  * If we imagine a commercial fire equivalent where a photograph is used as evidence of the cause of the fire, the
blockchain ledger can be used to provide chain of custody for all the evidence related to a single loss event.
Each request is returned a keyless signature which allows a third party to verify the transaction properties (time, identity,
integrity) of the data using the blockchain as a reference.
The keyless signature enables the individual properties and attributes of each transaction (including claims) to be verified
without reliance on trusted parties and manual intervention. There are no keys to be compromised or to revoke; just
mathematical proof of signing time, origin and integrity of the transaction. This, in turn, makes the electronic data tamper
evident and verifiable by anyone, helping to ensure that the historical provenance of the claim can be preserved.




* [Blockchain in insurance: applications and pursuing a path to adoption](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-blockhain-in-insurance/$FILE/EY-blockhain-in-insurance.pdf). Same as article above, just a bit shorter. Nice to check out anyway.

### Cool companies

* [Storing data with filecoin](https://filecoin.io/). Raising more than $257M, it is the largest closed token sale so far this year,

### How to actually code this stuff
