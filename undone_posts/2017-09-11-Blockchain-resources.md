Hey there you beautiful ladies and gentlemen, señoras y señores, damen und herren, 女士们(們) 先生们(們 ! Hope you have a great day. 
I will here just temporarily store my resources on Blockchain. Perhaps I will write my code here at Github too.. Lets see!


### Go to market


#### EY
* [Better-working
insurance: moving
blockchain from
concept to reality](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-better-working-insurance-moving-blockchain-from-concept-to-reality/$FILE/ey-better-working-insurance-moving-blockchain-from-concept-to-reality.pdf). 20-week proof-of-concept project with EY, Guardtime and Maersk. A working blockchain platform that connects every major stakeholder in the insurance value chain. 
** Challenges
*** It can
complicate risks in a number of areas. This is because
multiple parties in multiple jurisdictions – from ship
and cargo owners to surveyors and port authorities –
must align around a single insurance contract.
*** The great strength of blockchain – its ability to create
a single version of the truth – could also become a
source of systemic risk, if truth becomes falsehood.
There must be clear controls around what data
organizations are storing and what data participants
have permission to use.
