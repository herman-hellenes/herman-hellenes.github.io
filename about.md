title: About Me
---

Hi there! My topics of interest are machine learning, computing intensive optimization techniques, Ethereum development and how to successfully apply this in the business world. As well do I generally have a pleasure of learning new skills and getting better on what I already master. Feel free to get in touch by LinkedIn or email, which you find it in the bar menu.

My education is from ETH Zurich and Norwegian University of Science and Technology where I hold a M.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics. CFA from Norwegian School of Economics.
