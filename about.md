title: About Me
---

Hi there! My topics of interest are machine learning, computing intensive optimization techniques, Ethereum development and how to successfully apply this in the business world. As well do I generally have a pleasure of learning new skills and getting better on what I already master. Feel free to get in touch by LinkedIn or email, which you find it in the bar menu.

I am currently working as a Management Consultant and Data Scientist at EY. My education is from ETH Zurich and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, where I hold a M.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics. I specialized in Computational Physics.
