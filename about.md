I am currently a Data Scientist in Quantitative Advisory Services at EY. There I work with Customer Analytics within the Financial Services Industry. My education is from ETH Zurich and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, where I hold a M.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics. I specialized in Computational Physics. 

Topics of my interest are machine learning, computing intensive optimization techniques, Ethereum development and how to successfully apply this in the business world. Feel free to get in touch by LinkedIn or email, which you find it in the bar menu.
