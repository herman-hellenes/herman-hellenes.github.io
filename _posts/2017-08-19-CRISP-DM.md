Hey there you beautiful ladies and gentlemen, señoras y señores, damen und herren, 女士们(們) 先生们(們 ! Hope you have a great day. I am now making a "series" of posts regarding Project Management of Data Science/Mining projects. To have some inspiration for your upcoming consulting case, internal project or your master's thesis, I will share some of the frameworks I have been applying so far. In this post, I'll introduce Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). 


CRISP-DM is nothing more than a general step-wise process of how to do Data Mining. Some might think this seems silly, putting this into a framework. However, it is useful due to several resons. 
1. The framework is put up in the way you actually do data mining projects. It is quite logical that you need to gather data before analyzing, for example. 
2. It is nice to have a reference point within the team, so you can refere to steps along the way, as well as splitting tasks. In the same manner, you can just send the CRISP-DM documentation to a new arriving collegue for onboarding, instead of using hours of explaining your very custom process.
3. A framework helps you focus. It get messy rather quickly if the whole team jump back and fourth along the steps, as well as delegation gets easier.

For quite some time, CRISP-DM has been the favored methology within the industry, see the poll below made by [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-projects.html)

Let's concretizize the concept of CRISP-DM. The framework contains six steps. On every step, we can stop the whole process, or go back, if we are not satisfied to move further down the chain.

# Business Understanding 

Business Understanding is the first up. Here we define the problem, the wanted outcome, constraints, make a plan and so on. This is a more "general consulting" step, where workshops and asking around are key activities. We are far away from actually doing some analytics. In academia, it is akward to use the term Business Understanding, however it is still the same job to be done when trying to make a research paper. We need to find the right problem to solve, before we start solving it with prediction models and so on. A perfect solution to something nobody wants, is not very useful.

After the Business Understanding step, we dig into the Data Understaning step. The first thing now is to actually get our hands on the data. This is actually a own substep, that is a headace. Make sure to pay attention to this, it usually takes a lot of time and effort. For a project in a large firm, just to find the guy that can give you the data you want, can indeed be challenging. So when you first get the data, you check it out. Often the data is totally crap. You have to ask some other guys to get different data, and you anyway have to do a lot of work of understanding what the columns, rows, values really mean. This are the Describe Data and Data Exploration steps. Often you do this multiple times, and try to verify the data quality. All in all, Data Understaning must not be underrated. If your data is crap, the model will definately be crap. 


The six steps of CRISP-DM is shown in the figure below.
