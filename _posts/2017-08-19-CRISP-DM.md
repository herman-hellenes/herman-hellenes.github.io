Hey there you beautiful ladies and gentlemen, señoras y señores, damen und herren, 女士们(們) 先生们(們 ! Hope you have a great day. In this post, I'll introduce Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). 


CRISP-DM is nothing more than a general step-wise process of how to do Data Mining. Some might think this seems silly, putting this into a framework. However, it is useful due to several resons. 
1. The framework is put up in the way you actually do data mining projects. It is quite logical that you need to gather data before analyzing, for example. 
2. It is nice to have a reference point within the team, so you can refere to steps along the way, as well as splitting tasks. In the same manner, you can just send the CRISP-DM documentation to a new arriving collegue for onboarding, instead of using hours of explaining your very custom process.
3. A framework helps you focus. It get messy rather quickly if the whole team jump back and fourth along the steps, as well as delegation gets easier.

For quite some time, CRISP-DM has been the favored methology within the industry, see the poll below made by [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-projects.html)
